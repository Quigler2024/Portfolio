                    <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
                    <p>
                        I have developed strong graphic design skills through extensive hands-on experience using
                        <strong>Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign</strong>, which I use as my primary design
                        tools for both academic and personal projects. My design approach is grounded in visual
                        storytelling, where careful attention is given to composition, hierarchy, color, and typography
                        to ensure each piece communicates its intended message clearly and effectively to the audience.
                        I also place a strong emphasis on conceptual thinking, experimenting with shapes, textures, and
                        layering to create depth and visual interest, often drawing inspiration from branding,
                        editorial, and contemporary illustration styles.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Design</strong> has always been a significant influence on my creative process, shaping
                        how I approach problem-solving, concept development, and layout decisions. While I recognise
                        that there is still much to learn, I am highly motivated to continue developing my skills,
                        experimenting with new techniques, and refining my creative thinking when it comes to visual
                        communication. I am eager to grow as a designer and constantly challenge myself to improve,
                        using each project as a new opportunity to become more confident, inventive, and technically
                        proficient.

                        <h1>Basketball Poster</h1>
                        <h3>illustrator</h3>
                        <p>
                            This poster was created in Adobe Illustrator using a modern cartoon approach, building the
                            design entirely from shapes. I focused on bold colors, exaggerated forms, and dynamic
                            composition to capture the energy and fun of basketball. The project allowed me to
                            experiment with vector-based illustration while exploring stylization, visual hierarchy, and
                            movement. The final design combines playful cartoon aesthetics with a sense of motion,
                            creating an engaging and contemporary take on the sport.

                        <p>
                            This poster was created for the Killiney Golf Club event, Taste of Killiney, using Adobe
                            Illustrator. The bottle and wine elements were designed entirely from shapes, while the
                            fruit was generated with AI to add visual interest. The color palette and overall design
                            align with the Killiney Golf Club's branding, ensuring a cohesive and professional look.
                            Informational bubbles were incorporated to present event details clearly and hierarchically,
                            guiding the viewer's eye while maintaining a visually engaging layout. This project allowed
                            me to combine vector illustration, AI-generated elements, and brand-focused design in a
                            cohesive composition.

                        <h3>Photoshop, Indesign & illustrator</h3>
                        <p>
                            This album cover was created for a four-member band, incorporating the album title (Design
                            House), a hidden element, and all band members. The base layer features a duplicated image
                            of Earth with a swirl effect, creating depth and movement, while three blindfolded members
                            are positioned on the left and the fourth integrated seamlessly using color balance and
                            filters.
                            <br><br>
                            Skeletons were added to symbolize Design House as a “never-ending music piece,” representing
                            the enduring and cyclical nature of music and creativity. This adds a conceptual layer that
                            complements the visual narrative.
                            <br><br>
                            The album title uses inflated 3D typography, and the hidden element—a teddy beside the
                            title—is actually the letters “D & H” rotated horizontally. Overall, the design combines
                            layering, blending, and storytelling to create a cohesive and imaginative album cover.

                        <h3>Photoshop</h3>
                        <p>
                            This poster depicts a young boy in silhouette walking into the distance, with a dramatic
                            sunset behind him, while above, a soldier holding a gun gazes into the horizon. Flying jets
                            are layered subtly across the composition, and event details are displayed at the bottom to
                            indicate the movie's release. The design is inspired by the Saving Private Ryan poster and
                            explores themes of the American Dream during the Vietnam War.
                            <br><br>

                            For this assignment, only one AI-generated element was allowed, so I added a bag on the
                            boy's right hand. The original image did not include a bag, so I used AI to generate it in
                            the selected area, integrating it seamlessly with the figure.
                            <br><br>
                            The poster combines silhouette, layering, and subtle AI manipulation to create a cinematic,
                            evocative image. By balancing visual storytelling with historical and thematic references,
                            it communicates both mood and narrative while maintaining a cohesive and engaging
                            composition.

                            This poster is an experimental integration of Andy's bedroom from Toy Story and Mike
                            Wazowski from Monsters, Inc. Created as a personal project for fun, the piece explores 3D
                            objects, shadows, dimension, and colour. While the placement and shadow of Mike Wazowski
                            could be improved, the project allowed me to experiment freely with composition, lighting,
                            and visual layering.
                            <br><br>
                            As of now the poster remains unfinished, but it reflects a playful approach to creative
                            experimentation. Demonstrating exploration of techniques and visual storytelling in a
                            3D-inspired environment.

                            This logo was created for O'Brien Wines as part of a UCD assignment, integrating a wine
                            bottle (middle section), wine glass(on the right), and spirit bottle (on the left) into a
                            single cohesive design. The wine glass and
                            spirit bottle were designed separately, then carefully subtracted from the sides of the wine
                            bottle to create a unified composition.
                            <br><br>
                            The final design aligns with O'Brien Wines' branding guidelines, using a colour palette
                            consistent with their identity. The project allowed me to explore vector-based construction,
                            precise layering, and creative integration of multiple elements, resulting in a clean and
                            visually appealing logo.

                            This interactive branding brochure for O'Brien's was created in InDesign, incorporating
                            key annimation effects, text timing, image tracking, Google maps implementation, video
                            integration, and other interactive elements. The project itself highlights O'Brien's history

                            multimedia elements to create an engaging, dynamic presentation.
