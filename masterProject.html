                            <strong>MUSA = 'Museums For All"</strong> is a mobile-first platform built for and with the
                            Deaf community, featuring Irish Sign Language (ISL) videos, interactive 3D artifacts, and
                            playful learning tools to make art and culture accessible and engaging.
                        <p>

                            The platform allows users to scan QR codes at specific objects and artifacts around the
                            museum, and access ISL tour videos and other content specifically tailored to Deaf visitors,
                            allowing museum visitors who may not have otherwise been able to access a live guided tour
                            to experience the same informational and story-based content.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>The Idea-</strong> MUSA began as a student project by five MSc students at Trinity
                            College Dublin, all of whom share a love of art and a passion for accessible design. The
                            concept was motivated by a desire to tackle the significant barriers that Ireland's deaf
                            community faces while accessing museums and other cultural sites. Although ISL is the
                            country's third official language, many institutions still lack ISL content or tours. While
                            some larger Dublin institutions offer occasional ISL interpretation, these tours are too
                            infrequent to provide equitable access for many Deaf and hard-of-hearing visitors. To
                            address these geographic and resource inequalities, we aimed to develop a scalable solution:
                            ISL video tours for Irish museums.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>My Role-</strong> As the project manager for my Masters summer project, I was
                            responsible for coordinating the team, guiding the project direction, and ensuring clear
                            communication throughout the development process. I was also the only team member with
                            knowledge of Irish Sign Language and personal experience of discrimination when accessing
                            museum spaces, which gave me a unique and valuable perspective. Drawing from these lived
                            experiences, I proposed and pitched an inclusive project concept to both my team and the
                            wider class, advocating for accessibility-focused design and ensuring that underrepresented
                            voices were meaningfully considered from the earliest stages of the project.

                        <p>
                            In order to turn our vision into a reality, we needed to find a strong partner museum. We
                            reached out to several museums and institutions, but it was clear that The Hunt Museum was a
                            perfect fit due to its existing dedication to accessibility, working with Inclusive Museums
                            Ireland. This relationship allowed us to pilot our solution and see if it could truly meet
                            the needs of the Deaf community. Working with CEO, Teresa Crowley, and Curator of Education
                            and Outreach, Maria Cagney, we outlined the project parameters and identified potential
                            “hero objects” that would form the core of the first ISL tour.

                        <p>
                            We knew that to actually serve the Deaf community, our solution had to be co-created with
                            our users. This meant building meaningful relationships, conducting focus groups, and
                            sending surveys, instead of relying solely on secondary sources or assumptions. This became
                            the heart of our research and planning phase. With assistance from Deaf Village Ireland, the
                            Irish Deaf Society, the Trinity College Deaf Studies Department, and other regional Deaf
                            associations, we connected with Deaf community members passionate about art, culture, and
                            history who were eager to participate in developing accessible solutions. From early
                            conceptualization all the way through our user testing and launch, Deaf community members
                            were an integral part of the project.

                            In our focus groups, we explored lived experiences, recruiting participants from the Deaf
                            and Hard of Hearing (HOH) community to discuss the barriers they face when visiting museums
                            and their preferences for accessible digital content. This provided us with key insights on
                            preferred video length, caption usage, and the need for culturally authentic ISL
                            interpretation.

                        <p>
                            The feedback we received uncovered an urgent need for a shift in accessibility standards.
                            Several participants reported that interpreters were usually unavailable or that ISL support
                            was lacking entirely. A mobile website was seen not only as a helpful supplement but, in
                            many cases, as a potential alternative to in-person interpreting, particularly if the app
                            featured animated, expressive human presenters and offered flexibility in how and when
                            information could be accessed.
                            <br><br>
                            These focus-group findings were further reinforced by feedback from our surveys and
                            interviews with Deaf community leaders and educators, who highlighted the need for ISL
                            recognition and the persistent accessibility barriers they face.

                        <p>
                            After completing our research, we identified three core features essential to the site’s
                            success: ISL interpretation videos to ensure sign language remains the primary language of
                            the tour; interactive quiz and puzzle games to make the museum experience more engaging and
                            social; and 3D artifact models to support visual learning. An important step was working
                            with a certified Deaf ISL interpreter. Deaf interpreters bring native fluency, cultural
                            knowledge, and community trust, resulting in translations that are not only accurate but
                            also culturally appropriate and respectful.
                            <br><br>
                            Once the features were designed and implemented, we tested the site’s functionality and
                            collected user feedback. Participants completed tasks like navigating between pages to help
                            us evaluate usability. This process was critical for uncovering potential issues before the
                            site’s final development and launch.

                        <p>
                            The community launch event for MUSA at The Hunt Museum in Limerick on <strong>August 21,
                                2025</strong>, was a profound success that validated our co-creation process. The
                            turnout was strong, bringing together Deaf community members, museum staff, and
                            accessibility advocates. Attendees were especially appreciative that the event was hosted in
                            Limerick, noting that accessibility events and ISL tours typically concentrate in Dublin,
                            leaving them with limited access to cultural resources. This demonstrated that MUSA was a
                            significant step toward geographic equity. Furthermore, community members praised the
                            quality and authenticity of the ISL content, specifically noting the involvement of the
                            professional and respected Deaf ISL Interpreter, Lianne Quigley.
                            <br><br>
                            This celebration not only validated MUSA's technical functionality but also immediately
                            inspired questions about future expansion, with attendees eagerly asking, “Which museums
                            will you add next?” The day successfully marked MUSA's transition from an academic project
                            to a valued community resource.

                        <p>
                            What started as a class project quickly spiraled into something much bigger. The
                            overwhelmingly positive reception and clear demand from the community have solidified our
                            commitment to expanding MUSA. Our first major goal is to transform the current mobile-first
                            website into a native mobile app format, which will allow for a smoother, more integrated
                            user experience.
                            <br><br>
                            Concurrently, we are focused on expansion: we plan to initiate partnership
                            discussions with additional institutions to spread our ISL tours across Ireland, aiming to
                            replicate the MUSA model for museums of different sizes and collections. We are also
                            exploring opportunities to scale this reproducible model to American museums. As we move
                            into this next phase of growth and development, we are working with a dedicated mentor from
                            Trinity’s Women That Wow programme, who is supporting us as we seek funding and develop MUSA
                            as a sustainable resource.
