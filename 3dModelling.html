                                I have developed strong 3D modelling skills through extensive hands-on experience using
                                <strong>Blender, Meshroom, and Sketchfab</strong>, which I use as my primary tools for
                                both academic and personal projects. My approach is grounded in combining technical
                                precision with creative exploration, carefully considering topology, lighting,
                                texturing, and rendering to ensure each model communicates its intended form and
                                function effectively. I also place a strong emphasis on photogrammetry and real-world
                                reference integration, often using Meshroom to capture accurate environments and
                                Sketchfab to present interactive, web-ready 3D models for immersive visualisation.

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                My first 3D modelling project involved creating an iron using 3dx MAX, focusing on basic
                                geometric construction and the application of spline pipe techniques. I combined a
                                triangle, rectangle, and spline-based pipe shapes to construct the overall form,
                                carefully considering proportions, alignment, and curvature to achieve a clean and
                                realistic silhouette.
                                <br><br>
                                This assignment allowed me to understand the fundamentals of 3D modelling, including
                                mesh
                                creation, object manipulation, and precise shape integration. It served as an essential
                                exercise in developing spatial awareness, control over 3dx Max tools, and
                                understanding how simple geometric forms can be combined to create recognizable,
                                functional objects.

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                This project focused on exploring object intersection and subtraction techniques in
                                Blender. Using a cube and a sphere, I experimented with Boolean operations to subtract
                                and combine shapes, learning how different geometries interact in 3D space.
                                <br><br>
                                The exercise allowed me to develop a stronger understanding of mesh topology, precise
                                alignment, and clean geometry, while also improving my skills in manipulating complex
                                forms. This foundational practice helped reinforce the principles of constructive and
                                destructive modelling, which are essential for creating more intricate 3D objects.

                                This project involved creating a fully realized 3D TV room scene in
                                <strong>Blender</strong>,
                                incorporating all required key elements: a transmissive/refractive object (glass), a
                                highly reflective surface, a bump-mapped/normal-mapped object, a texture-mapped object,
                                carefully positioned lights and shadows, and a surrounding 3D environment. I carefully
                                designed and arranged each element to create a cohesive, realistic interior while
                                balancing visual interest and spatial composition.

                                The room was also required to have at least five pop culture toy objects made from

                                were the Pac-Man arcade set, the Pokémon ball, the Nintendo Playboy, the Rubik’s Cube,
                                the Nintendo Switch, and the teddy bear.

                                            avoid uniformity and create a natural, organic look. Some books lean against

                                            contrast in both material and form. The smooth, slightly glossy ceramic
                                            surfaces were designed to reflect light subtly, differentiating them from
                                            the harder, more reflective marble tabletop. This contrast helps emphasize
                                            material realism and adds visual depth to the scene.

                                            Their placement was carefully considered to feel natural and functional
                                            rather than staged. The vase acts as a central anchor on the table, while
                                            the cups are positioned with slight spacing and variation in rotation to
                                            suggest everyday use. Subtle shadows and reflections were used to ground the
                                            objects on the marble surface, reinforcing their weight and presence within
                                            the room and enhancing the overall sense of realism.

                                            adjusted lighting, creating a more realistic depiction of their material
                                            qualities. Soft, directional light was used to produce subtle highlights and
                                            gentle reflections on the ceramic surfaces, helping to define their
                                            curvature and smooth finish.

                                            The interaction between light and shadow enhances realism by showing slight
                                            variations in brightness across the objects, rather than a flat appearance.
                                            Reflections from the marble table further reinforce the material contrast,
                                            allowing the ceramics to feel grounded within the scene and visually
                                            integrated into the overall lighting environment.

                                            The Pac-Man arcade set was modelled from scratch in Blender and designed to
                                            act as a focal point within the TV room. Its recognizable shape and scale
                                            help anchor the scene, while the proportions were carefully adjusted to
                                            maintain realism and visual balance within the environment. The cabinet was
                                            constructed using clean geometry, with attention given to sharp edges, panel
                                            separation, and overall structure.

                                            The Nintendo Playboy was modelled and placed on the leather sofa to add
                                            character and a sense of personality to the room. Its positioning was
                                            carefully considered, resting at a slight angle on the cushions to avoid a
                                            rigid or artificial look. This placement helps suggest casual use,
                                            reinforcing the idea of the space being lived in rather than staged.

                                            Material contrast was an important factor in this detail. The smooth, flat
                                            surface of the Nintendo Playboy contrasts with the textured leather material
                                            of the sofa, while subtle shadows and surface contact help ground the object
                                            realistically. Lighting was used to softly highlight the edges and surface,
                                            allowing it to integrate naturally into the scene while contributing to the
                                            overall narrative and realism of the environment.

                                            screen to simulate a powered-on device, casting a subtle green glow onto the

                                            The Nintendo Switch and Rubik's Cube were placed on the marble table to
                                            introduce variation in scale, color, and material. Their placement was
                                            carefully balanced to avoid clutter, with slight spacing and angled
                                            positioning to create a natural, everyday arrangement rather than a
                                            perfectly aligned setup.

                                            Material contrast plays a key role in this composition. The smooth,
                                            semi-matte surfaces of the Nintendo Switch contrast with the glossy,
                                            patterned finish of the Rubik's Cube, while both objects stand out against
                                            the reflective marble tabletop. Subtle reflections and shadows help ground
                                            the objects, reinforcing their weight and presence while contributing to a
                                            realistic and visually engaging scene.

                                This virtual field trip assignment focused on recreating a well-known Dublin landmark
                                using photogrammetry and 3D workflows. I selected <strong>Luke Kelly's head
                                    statue</strong>, a tribute to
                                one of Ireland's most influential folk musicians and a founding member of The Dubliners.
                                Luke Kelly is remembered for his powerful voice, political activism, and lasting impact
                                on Irish music and culture.

                                Using <strong>Meshroom</strong>, the statue was reconstructed from photographic data to
                                generate a
                                detailed 3D scan. The model was then cleaned and refined in <strong>Blender</strong>,
                                where issues such
                                as mesh errors, noise, and surface imperfections were corrected. Finally, the finished
                                model was uploaded to <strong>Sketchfab</strong> to create an interactive, web-based 3D
                                experience,
                                allowing the piece to be explored digitally while preserving an important part of

                            Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the material maps could not be consolidated into a
                            single UV layout, so they did not transfer correctly to Sketchfab. As a result, only the
                            base geometry and default shading are visible in the interactive model, rather than the
                            fully textured version created in Blender.

                                        <p>After transferring the Luke Kelly model from Meshroom to Blender, the skin
                                            had numerous holes and some areas of hair were missing. These gaps were
                                            corrected by duplicating sections of hair textures and carefully readjusting
                                            parts of the head to restore the overall form. The skin and surface details
                                            were refined using Blender's healing, inflating, and smudging brushes,
                                            ensuring a smooth, realistic appearance while maintaining the integrity of
                                            the original scan.

                                        <p>The UV map revealed areas where the skin particles and segmented geometry
                                            were duplicated and merged to fill gaps in the model. These cloned sections
                                            had to be carefully reconstructed and adjusted to ensure continuity and
                                            natural flow, preserving the overall shape and realism of Luke Kelly's head.
